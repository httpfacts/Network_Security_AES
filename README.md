# Network_Security_AES

This small project demonstrates AES-GCM encryption/decryption in the browser using the Web Crypto API.

Files:
- `index.html` — home page (explain AES and links)
- `aes.html` — interactive demo page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `aes.js` — encryption/decryption logic (PBKDF2 -> AES-GCM)

## How to run locally
1. Place files in a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge).
3. Go to `AES Demo`, enter a password & plaintext, click **Encrypt**, then click **Decrypt** to verify.

## How to publish (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a repo (e.g. `Network_Security_AES`) on GitHub.
2. Push these files to the `main` branch.
3. Settings → Pages → Source → Select `main` branch / root → Save.
4. Your site will be available at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/Network_Security_AES/`

## Screenshots
Put screenshots (PNG/JPG) into `screenshots/` folder and reference them in pages or in your project report.

## Notes for assignment
- Explain AES on the home page (already included).
- Provide algorithm explanation in your report (copy-paste from `index.html`).
- Add screenshots of the demo page (showing encrypted text and decrypted result).
